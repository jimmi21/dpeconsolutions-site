### Income Tax Brackets (2024-2025)

|-------------|------|
| 0 - 10,000 | 9% |
| 10,001 - 20,000 | 22% |
| 20,001 - 30,000 | 28% |
| 30,001 - 40,000 | 36% |
| 40,001+ | 44% |

### Child Credits
| Children | Credit |
|----------|--------|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 900 |
| 2 | 1,120 |
| 3 | 1,340 |
| 4 | 1,580 |
| 5 | 1,780 |
| 6+ | +220/child |
